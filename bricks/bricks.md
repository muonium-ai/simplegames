Here is a structured **requirements document** for implementing a 

## **Brick Breaking Game Requirements (Python + Pygame)**

### **1. General Overview**
The game consists of a paddle at the bottom of the screen, a bouncing ball, and a wall of bricks at the top. The objective is to break all bricks by bouncing the ball off the paddle.

### **2. Functional Requirements**

#### **2.1 Game Window**
- The game window should have a fixed resolution (e.g., **800x600** pixels).
- The background should be a solid color or a subtle texture.
- The **score and remaining lives** should be displayed on the screen.

#### **2.2 Game Objects**
- **Paddle:**
  - A horizontal rectangular paddle positioned at the bottom of the screen.
  - Moves **left and right** using the arrow keys.
  - The paddle cannot move outside the screen boundaries.

- **Ball:**
  - A circular object that moves in both X and Y directions.
  - The ball is **launched with the Spacebar**, starting from the paddle’s center.
  - The ball **bounces** off walls and the paddle.
  - If the ball **falls below** the paddle, the player loses a life, and a new ball is launched.

- **Bricks:**
  - A grid of rectangular bricks positioned at the top of the screen.
  - Bricks disappear when hit by the ball.
  - Different brick types can have **different durability (1-hit, 2-hit, etc.)**.

#### **2.3 Controls**
- **Move Paddle Left:** Left Arrow (`←`)
- **Move Paddle Right:** Right Arrow (`→`)
- **Launch Ball:** Spacebar (`SPACE`)

#### **2.4 Scoring System**
- Players earn **points for each brick destroyed**.
- Stronger bricks give **more points**.
- The score should be displayed on the screen.

#### **2.5 Lives System**
- The player starts with a limited number of **lives** (e.g., 3).
- Losing all lives ends the game.

#### **2.6 Ball Physics**
- The ball should bounce off walls and the paddle.
- The ball’s bounce angle changes depending on where it hits the paddle.
- When the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears (or reduces durability).
- If all bricks are destroyed, the player wins the level.

#### **2.7 Levels**
- The game may have multiple levels, with **bricks arranged differently** in each level.
- After clearing a level, a new set of bricks should appear.

#### **2.8 Game Over and Restart**
- If the player loses all lives, a **"Game Over"** screen appears.
- If all bricks are cleared, a **"You Win"** message is displayed.
- The game should allow the player to restart after game over.

#### **2.9 Sound Effects**
- A sound should play when the ball hits a brick.
- A different sound should play when the ball bounces off the paddle or walls.
- A "loss" sound should play when the ball falls below the paddle.

#### **3. Technical Requirements**
- The game must be implemented using **Python (version 3.x)**.
- The **Pygame** library should be used for rendering, input handling, and physics.
- The game logic should be implemented using **functions and/or object-oriented programming (OOP)**.
- The game should handle edge cases (e.g., ball stuck, multiple collisions in a frame).

#### **4. Optional Enhancements**
- Add **power-ups** (e.g., larger paddle, multi-ball, fireball).
- Implement **different brick types** (e.g., unbreakable bricks).
- Introduce **progressive difficulty** (e.g., faster ball, moving bricks).
- Implement a **pause menu** (`P` key to pause, `R` key to restart).
- Add **background music**.
