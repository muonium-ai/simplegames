# Game of Life - Requirements Document

## Overview
Implement Conway's Game of Life using Pygame, creating an interactive cellular automaton simulation.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
1. Grid System
   - Create a 2D grid of cells
   - Each cell should be either alive (filled) or dead (empty)
   - Grid size should be configurable

2. Game Rules
   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives
   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
   - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)

3. User Interface
   - Display the grid using Pygame
   - Each cell should be visually distinct
   - Grid lines should be visible
   - Window size should be adjustable

### User Interactions
1. Controls
   - Left mouse click to toggle cells alive/dead
   - Spacebar to pause/resume simulation
   - 'R' key to reset/clear the grid
   - 'Q' key to quit the application

### Technical Specifications
1. Technologies
   - Python 3.x
   - Pygame library

2. Performance
   - Minimum 10 FPS
   - Support for at least 50x50 grid

3. Display
   - Cell size: 10-20 pixels
   - Grid color: Light gray
   - Live cells: Black
   - Dead cells: White

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Use object-oriented programming
2. Separate game logic from display logic
3. Implement efficient neighbor counting
4. Use double buffering for smooth animation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Save/Load game states
2. Different color schemes
3. Adjustable simulation speed
4. Predefined patterns
5. Grid size adjustment during runtime
