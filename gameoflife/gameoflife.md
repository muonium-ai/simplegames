# Game of Life - Requirements Document

## Overview
Implement Conway's Game of Life using Pygame, creating an interactive cellular automaton simulation.

## Technical Requirements

### Core Features
1. Grid System
   - Create a 2D grid of cells
   - Each cell should be either alive (filled) or dead (empty)
   - Grid size should be configurable

2. Game Rules
   - Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation)
   - Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives
   - Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation)
   - Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes alive (reproduction)

3. User Interface
   - Display the grid using Pygame
   - Each cell should be visually distinct
   - Grid lines should be visible
   - Window size should be adjustable

### User Interactions
1. Controls
   - Left mouse click to toggle cells alive/dead
   - Spacebar to pause/resume simulation
   - 'R' key to reset/clear the grid
   - 'Q' key to quit the application

### Technical Specifications
1. Technologies
   - Python 3.x
   - Pygame library

2. Performance
   - Minimum 10 FPS
   - Support for at least 50x50 grid

3. Display
   - Cell size: 10-20 pixels
   - Grid color: Light gray
   - Live cells: Black
   - Dead cells: White

## Implementation Guidelines
1. Use object-oriented programming
2. Separate game logic from display logic
3. Implement efficient neighbor counting
4. Use double buffering for smooth animation

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
1. Save/Load game states
2. Different color schemes
3. Adjustable simulation speed
4. Predefined patterns
5. Grid size adjustment during runtime

Conway's Game of Life can indeed be extended with **color variations** and **breeding-inspired mechanics**, creating richer visual dynamics and novel evolutionary behaviors. Here's how these concepts are implemented:

---

## Color Variations  
Several colorized variants introduce additional states (colors) while preserving the core Life rules, creating complex visual patterns:

1. **Immigration (2-color)**  
   - Newborn cells adopt the **majority color** of their parent cells[1][6][10].  
   - Used in projects like the *Arduino Bi-color LED Matrix* to visualize generations (new cells = green, survivors = red/orange)[2].

2. **Quad-Life (4-color)**  
   - Birth color is determined by:  
     - Majority parent color, or  
     - The *remaining color* if all three parents are different (e.g., red+green+blue → yellow)[1][6].  
   - Enables **multi-period oscillators** (e.g., a 12-tick glider instead of 4)[1].

3. **Spectral Life (7-color)**  
   - Blends colors using additive/subtractive mixing rules (e.g., red+green → yellow)[6].  
   - Projects like *Conway Color Life* implement aging-based color shifts for cells[12][15].

---

## Breeding Strategies  
Breeding mechanics in Life often refer to **pattern propagation** or **genetic algorithms**:

### A. Self-Replicating Patterns  
1. **Breeders**  
   - **Quadratic growth** patterns like *Gosper’s breeder* spawn infinite glider guns or puffers[4][7].  
   - Types include *SSS breeders* (stationary) and *MMS breeders* (mobile)[4].  

2. **Slide Guns/Rakes**  
   - Produce streams of spaceships or oscillators, enabling controlled "offspring" generation[7][14].  

### B. Algorithmic Breeding  
1. **Genetic Algorithms**  
   - Projects use evolutionary algorithms to evolve patterns meeting criteria (e.g., longevity, symmetry)[8].  
   - Parent configurations "mate" via crossover/mutation, with fitness guiding selection[8].  

2. **Symbiopoiesis Models**  
   - Patterns interact epigenetically, where environmental conditions (neighboring cells) influence "gene expression"[3][11].

## Implementation Examples  
| Project | Key Feature |  
|---------|-------------|  
| [Oct-Life](https://conwaylife.com/ref/mniemiec/color.htm)[1] | 8-color system with complementary sets |  
| [Conway Color Life](https://therealmattkain.itch.io/conway-color-life)[12] | Age-based color gradients and theme options |  
| [Genetic Algorithm Simulator](https://github.com/Dor-sketch/game-of-life-ai)[8] | AI-driven pattern evolution |  

These adaptations demonstrate how color and breeding mechanics can enhance Life’s complexity while preserving its computational universality[14].
