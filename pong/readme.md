Here’s a structured set of requirements for implementing a **Pong** game using **Python** and **Pygame**.

---

### **Pong Game Requirements (Python + Pygame)**

#### **1. General Overview**
The Pong game is a two-player game where each player controls a paddle to hit a ball back and forth. The objective is to score points by making the ball pass the opponent’s paddle.

#### **2. Functional Requirements**

##### **2.1 Game Window**
- The game window should have a fixed resolution (e.g., **800x600** pixels).
- The background should be a solid color or a simple texture.
- A **dashed center line** should divide the screen into two halves.

##### **2.2 Game Objects**
- **Ball**:
  - A circular object that moves in both the X and Y directions.
  - It should bounce off the top and bottom walls.
  - It should reflect off paddles at an angle depending on the collision point.
  - If the ball moves past a paddle, the opponent scores a point.
  - After a point is scored, the ball should reset to the center.
  
- **Paddles**:
  - Two rectangular paddles controlled by players.
  - Left paddle (Player 1) and Right paddle (Player 2).
  - Each paddle should be able to move up and down within the screen limits.

##### **2.3 Controls**
- **Player 1 (Left Paddle):**
  - Move up: `W` key
  - Move down: `S` key
- **Player 2 (Right Paddle):**
  - Move up: `UP` arrow key
  - Move down: `DOWN` arrow key

##### **2.4 Scoring System**
- Each time a player misses the ball, the opponent gains **one point**.
- The score should be displayed on the screen.
- A player wins when they reach a pre-defined score (e.g., 10 points).
- After a win, the game should display a "Game Over" message and restart after a delay.

##### **2.5 Ball Physics**
- The ball should start at the center and move in a random direction.
- The ball should speed up slightly after each successful hit.
- Collisions should follow basic reflection physics.

##### **2.6 Sound Effects**
- A sound should play when the ball hits a paddle.
- A different sound should play when the ball hits the top or bottom walls.
- A point-scoring sound should be played when a player scores.

##### **2.7 Game Loop**
- The game should run at a fixed frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS).
- It should constantly check for events (e.g., player input, collisions).
- The screen should be updated in real time.

##### **2.8 Pause and Restart**
- Pressing the `P` key should pause the game.
- Pressing the `R` key should restart the game.

#### **3. Technical Requirements**
- The game must be implemented using **Python** (version 3.x).
- The **Pygame** library should be used for rendering, input handling, and game logic.
- The game should be structured using functions and/or object-oriented programming (OOP).
- The program should handle exceptions gracefully (e.g., handling key presses when the game is paused).
- The game should be executable as a single script.

#### **4. Optional Enhancements**
- Add AI for a single-player mode.
- Implement a difficulty setting (easy, medium, hard).
- Add a power-up system (e.g., ball speed boost).
- Use sprites instead of simple shapes for paddles and ball.
- Implement a main menu with options to start, pause, and quit.
