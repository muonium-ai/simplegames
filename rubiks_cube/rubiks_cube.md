# Rubik's Cube Solver Requirements

## Overview
- Develop an interactive Rubik's Cube solver with a visual interface using Pygame.
- Provide both manual manipulation and automated solving.
- Display cube animations, rotations, and solving steps.

## Display & UI Requirements
1. Render a 3D or isometric view of the Rubik's Cube.
2. Provide smooth animations for cube twists and rotations.
3. Controls:
   - Mouse/keyboard for manual rotations.
   - Buttons for scramble, solve, and reset.
4. Visual indicators for:
   - Cube faces and colors.
   - Solving steps progress.

## Solver Algorithm Requirements
1. Implement a Rubik's Cube solving algorithm (e.g., Kociemba's algorithm or similar).
2. Allow automated solution:
   - Show step-by-step moves.
   - Animate moves in the UI.
3. Optionally, support both beginners' and advanced solution methods.

## Input & Event Handling
1. Allow manual intervention:
   - Users can click/drag to rotate specific cube layers.
   - Keyboard shortcuts for face moves.
2. Provide a scramble function to generate random cube states.
3. Enable toggling between manual play and automatic solving.

## Code Organization
1. **Main Module**: Initializes Pygame, sets up the main game loop.
2. **Cube Module**:
   - Class for Rubik's Cube state containing face color data.
   - Methods for applying rotations and verifying solved state.
3. **Solver Module**:
   - Implements the chosen algorithm.
   - Produces a sequence of moves required to solve a given cube state.
4. **UI Module**:
   - Handles rendering the cube.
   - Manages user input and animation of moves.
5. **Event Manager**:
   - Separates event handling for manual controls and solver triggers.

## Development Guidelines
1. Use Python 3.x and the Pygame library.
2. Ensure code modularity with clear separation of concerns.
3. Provide comments and documentation for complex algorithmic parts.
4. Aim for smooth animations independent of frame rate.
5. Allow configuration of display settings and cube size.
